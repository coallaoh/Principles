# Principles

Date: 2 Aug 2021

Under the pandemic, communications have moved into the virtual world. The current technology is only so good at allowing virtual communications at a compromised bandwidth. Buried in everyday agenda that require much attention and quick decisions, I am losing chances to communicate more fundamental ideas with people. Those trapped ideas first spilt over my brain capacity and so I had to put them down in a personal note. But eventually, I believe that ideas shine only when they are shared with others and get appraised and corrected accordingly.

I will start sharing those ideas on Github. Over the next few months or so, I will be publishing the underlying principles for my life and research. The writing will be far from being final in a foreseeable future - I will keep updating the principles until I cannot, e.g. because of disability and death. I am treating this document as an experimental log for my own life: write down a hypothesis, test it with life experiences, analyse them, and either introduce a new principle or modify an existing one.

I hope to clearly communicate the underlying reasoning behind my arguments, actions, and life trajectory. It will help to identify if two different viewpoints stem from factual misconception or fundamentally misaligned principles. Being blind to the latter can waste a significant amount of time and energy. Spelling out the principles can also help us be transparent and avoid clinging to authority. I hate to become an adamant old man who has many strong opinions without a strong reasoning.

I credit the idea of organising the principles to Ray Dalio and his book, [_Principles_](https://www.principles.com/). Ray, likewise, has introduced a systematic approach to life: let principles be crystallised out of the myriads of trial and error in life. Huge respect for his scientific-minded approach to his own life and work. I have also inherited some of my principles from his.

I have organised the principles according to (1) ones that can be applied to my personal life and (2) ones that relate to the research life, taking a hint from Ray’s organisation in Principles. Unlike Ray, who has put equal weight on every principle, I will put a “status label” for each principle item:

- **Conjecture**: Principles that are not tested with my own experience yet. They include second-hand experiences and pieces of advice from trustable, experienced people.
- **Lemma**: Conjectures or newly introduced principles that have been verified through my own experiences.
- **Theorem**: Lemmas that have passed the test of time (10 years).

This lets an under-experienced person like myself (30 years old) put confidence scores on different principles. Each principle will also be time-stamped with “created” and “modified” dates. I will also do my best to put anecdotes and supporting examples for each principle. It may not be possible to immediately disclose accounts that are too personal; I will be discreet in terms of opening up personal experiences, especially the ones that touch on the privacy of others. I will probably be able to open them up over the years when the involved persons can be sufficiently anonymised.
