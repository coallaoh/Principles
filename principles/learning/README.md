# Principles for Learning

Learning is a lifetime profession for me. It goes beyond school and university. It includes new technologies, first-time leadership, parenthood. I have had major learning events every four years or so; I expect this to continue.

Learning is difficult. It happens only outside the comfort zone. It is easier to settle on a few skills to make a living. Why keep learning?

- First, for maximum diversity of experience. I'm designed to explore diverse experiences until I feel complete by death. I cannot stop at a comfortable plateau.
- Second, the 21st century demands it. The world changes at unprecedented speed. Skills useful today will become obsolete within a decade. Stagnation is not an option.


There are two approaches to learning: bottom-up and top-down. Most formal education is bottom-up. Most real-world challenges require top-down. 


## 1. Bottom-up learning

Bottom-up learning means you follow established curricula. You study textbooks thoroughly and progress to harder materials. This approach suits long-term training of foundational skills. For me, that meant piano and maths.

**Piano.** I have wanted to play Chopin's Ballade No. 4 since 2009. I had played the same piece for almost a decade, only to realise this would only get me so far. A piano instructor helped me cross this barrier. I went back to basic skills through pieces by Mozart and Bach. These pieces led me to a new level where I could play the difficult Chopin work better. Some skills require carefully designed curricula that confer transferable skills.

**Maths.** Many theorems I learned are never used in professional life - Bolzano-Weierstrass, for example. But I learned the language of mathematics: how to turn hand-wavy intuitions into precise, quantifiable hypotheses. Immersion in bottom-up learning brings command of this language faster. Maths studies also become top-down at graduate level, as one specialises in a sub-domain and curricula and textbooks become scarce.

**Language.** I learned English bottom-up first, through school years, then top-down in the UK. Top-down was much faster - survival demanded it. But bottom-up gave me unusual SAT and GRE vocabulary and an understanding of English composition. These may not come from the top-down process. I see value in both approaches.


## 2. Top-down learning

Top-down learning is often the only learning method available for real-world challenges. Research, leadership, and parenting have no proven curricula. Most education systems train us in bottom-up; follow the curriculum, complete the assignments. Top-down is more challenging because we have not received proper training of this meta-skill.

Top-down learning has three steps.

1. **Set the goal.** Start from the top. What do you want to achieve?
2. **Break down the gap.** Gauge the gap between where you are and where you want to be. Break that gap into smaller sub-goals, and those into even smaller pieces, until you have tasks that can be completed in a day or an hour.
3. **Execute with diligence.** Fill in the gap every day. No matter what.

### 2-a. Top-down with existing curricula

Even when a fixed or recommended curriculum exists, I prefer to turn it top-down.

**American history.** I attended a competitive boarding school in Korea. Graduates went to Harvard, Stanford, MIT. To impress admissions committees, I was advised to take AP exams, including US History. I come from a totally Korean background; never imagined myself memorising presidents and winning parties for the entire US history. Given the goal of getting 5/5, I broke down the materials into manageable pieces. A 1000-page textbook became a 2-week sprint with 100 pages each day. An unreasonably big goal becomes manageable when broken down. All that remains is to execute; just sit down and do it. Forget about competition, despite formidable peers. Focus on what you can do. I applied this strategy to all 10 AP subjects and got 5/5 on each.

**Maths.** I met even crazier classmates at Cambridge - Maths Olympiad medallists and prodigies like Arran Fernandez, who was 3 years younger than the class and eventually became the youngest Senior Wrangler ever. I learned the same principle works for maths. Given the fixed goal of getting a First, I broke down the goal into manageable pieces. (1) Understand and memorise every theorem, proof, and logical connection. (2) Try exercise questions and past exams. All that remains is to execute the plan daily. I went to lectures and supervisions only when necessary, with a clear reason why I needed to attend. The director of studies at some point scolded me for skipping some mandatory sessions. I needed a clear reason to attend; otherwise I used that time elsewhere. With this top-down strategy, I got Firsts in 3 out of 4 years at Cambridge.

### 2-b. Purely top-down

After the undergrad education, every learning experience had to be purely top-down. Bottom-up curricula were no longer available.

**PhD.** I did my PhD in machine learning. From the very first day in the office, there is pressure to publish. The gap between a fresh maths graduate and a publication at a top-tier computer vision conference seemed enormous. Even the very basics like Linux commands, Python coding, and cross-entropy loss had to be learned. I needed to install Caffe from scratch; there was no such thing as `pip install Caffe` at the time. I also needed to understand what ideas are publishable, track the state of the art, and learn the fundamentals of machine learning. On top of all this, I needed a novel idea to make a publication. These were all part of a giant gap I had to fill in. What makes research harder is the difficulty of estimating the work needed for each item. How does one gauge the time needed to come up with a novel working solution? One needs not only to break down a fixed goal into deterministic pieces, but also to break down a *big risk* into manageable daily risks. With this top-down learning experience, I submitted my first paper in six months. It was accepted at ICCV 2015. See the [research principles](../research) document for more on low-risk, high-return research. 

**Industrial researcher.** I worked at Naver as a research scientist after my PhD. Research organisations at companies are often based on executives' instinct that they need to do something about AI to survive in 10 years. They often find it difficult to define exactly what to ask these research orgs to do - can they just write academic papers or should they contribute to products and businesses from now on? This was exactly the case at Naver. There were no concrete goals or KPIs given to individual researchers, apart from vague signals: do research somehow, but also contribute to product if possible. While confusing, this gave me a good opportunity to think about self-defined goals beyond individual projects. I thought deeply about impact of research. Who is the eventual beneficiary of research? I started dreaming of something bigger than individual research papers. See [goals](../../goals) section for more detail. It also became evident that achieving what I want eventually requires organisations, rather than me as an individual. This created another big gap to fill in; vision, leadership, social connections, and a good understanding of human nature and socioeconomic structure.

**Leading teams.** I am currently leading the research group Scalable Trustworthy AI at University of Tübingen and soon KAIST, as well as products like [ResearchTrend.AI](https://researchtrend.ai) and [NowDo.ai](https://nowdo.ai). They are an essential part of the path to my life goal. It is an opportunity to build impactful research topics, and an educational opportunity to learn to lead an organisation. I have my own life goal; the organisation has its own goal; organisation members have their own goals. Aligning them is very difficult. This is a great learning experience of what is possible and what is not. Money is not the fundamental driver to align goals, unless given in enormous amounts. I am also learning about my own limitations in capacity; one has to become good at selection of goals. I am learning to integrate AI into projects to increase productivity, what can be delegated and what cannot, and how to scale up projects by hiring the right people and growing with them.


## 3. Essentials for top-down learning

Top-down learning requires more than just breaking down goals. It demands the right questions, the right teachers, and the right mindset. Continuously ask yourself: What is the goal? How do I break down the gap? Then find people who can help you fill that gap, and approach learning with connection rather than competition.

**Learning from another person.** Do not wait until that person gives you the needed teaching. Ask good questions to let them teach you in the right way. Can I fill in the gap when the other person answers my question? Good questions like this are surprisingly rare. The greatest issue is people's reluctance to reveal their own ignorance. If you consistently ask good questions and do not let the answers slip by, you can learn efficiently. Continuously evaluate whether the other person's answer solves your question. It is rare for one answer to resolve all your curiosity. That is why you ask follow-up questions.

**Probing questions.** These are questions like "but why?" Persistently re-question the parts that are still abstract in the other person's answer. Keep probing. Eventually, there comes a moment when the other person finds it hard to answer. You enter the realm of philosophical questions that touch on life principles. There is much to learn in this process, and much to learn about the other person's principles. When you reach this level, you form a deeper connection. Many people are uncomfortable with probing questions. They prefer to just get along. Some people do not have a philosophical realm at all. If you find someone with whom this is possible, make them a mentor.

**Where to find your teacher.** Quite naturally, your supervisor, director, mentor, advisor, or boss. But also colleagues and people you manage or hire. In each case, think about what you can offer in return to the teaching, especially if it is someone you manage or hire. If you have money or resources, hiring someone outside your expertise is a good opportunity to learn something. You can also offer your own expertise in return; this creates great mutual motivation for building collaborative projects. Value your connections.

**Avoid competitive mindset.** Competition rarely helps learning. Even in the most competitive places, one should strive to learn from and teach each other. Comparison with others distracts from the real goal: filling in the gap between where you are and where you want to be. I rarely see anyone who compares a lot with others succeed in the long run. Forget about competition. Connect more than you isolate. 

**Research as learning.** One could think of research as a giant learning experience for the community or humanity itself. What state do we want to reach? How do we fill in the gap? What are the intermediate states we can set as realistic goals? A research question should be formulated similarly; does the answer to this question lead to the next step?

**Reading papers.** Reading a research paper is different from reading a textbook. It is more akin to interacting with the researcher who wrote the paper. Do not absorb everything as you would for a textbook. Before reading, think about what questions should be answered. Write them down. After reading the paper, answer the initial questions. In most cases, the paper does not answer many of your questions. In many cases, the paper answers the very question but breeds even more questions. Iterate this loop with many papers. Afterwards, you will see which questions still remain after years of research. These are research questions. If you just read from beginning to end without purpose, you have most likely wasted your time.

## 4. Learning in the AI era

AI changes learning fundamentally. Once a goal is defined, putting that into AI as a prompt often solves the problem. It is very easy to skip the learning process entirely while solving the problem.

Here is the irony. Good AI use requires meta-learning skills; structuring the problem clearly, choosing context carefully, formulating intention without ambiguity, and critically verifying outputs. But using AI skips the process that builds those skills. Without them, users write careless prompts and copy answers without thought. The result is *AI slop*: generic, low-quality work.

Some argue that AI will soon become good enough that careful prompting will not matter. I disagree. AI is fundamentally limited by human inputs. Context is vast and humans often fail to provide the right context. Better models, GPUs, and data will not solve this. A fundamental shift in AI paradigm is needed, and that is at least 5 years away, if not 10 years. In the meantime, AI outputs will still require careful human inspection and verification.

I see a generational divide forming. Those who developed learning habits before AI will continue to learn and use AI as a tool. Those who grew up with AI may never develop the discipline or see the need for learning at all. For future generations, we may need to devise bottom-up curricula for critical thinking and problem structuring. AI strips away the motivation to learn the hard way. We may need to find other ways to build these foundations.
