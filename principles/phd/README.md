# Principles for a PhD Program

I would like to share my perspective on a PhD program in machine learning without delving into a historical, authoritative, and discipline-generic definition. Instead, I aim to provide a practical and contemporary interpretation specifically applicable to machine learning.

The primary objective is to provide current and prospective PhD students in our research group with a clearer understanding of the program's goals and procedures. It is essential to articulate the program offered before advertising it. I would like to demystify the PhD program with a concrete picture of the expectations and syllabus involved. 

Additionally, I hope this can serve as a helpful resource for students beyond our research group, presenting a potential roadmap for their PhD studies. It may prove beneficial to other supervisors as a supplementary resource.

The concept of a "PhD" in this document does not exclusively refer to an official PhD program. It is possible to achieve the same end result without relying on an official program.


## 1. What is expected from a PhD graduate?

When I come across an individual with a doctorate, I hold specific expectations in mind. Here, I outline three significant aspects and describe both the minimum and ideal levels of accomplishment. The minimum requirements align with the graduation criteria within my research group.

An effective PhD program should empower students to:

- Cultivate essential research management skills.
- Acquire expertise in their chosen field.
- Contribute to and take leadership roles within a research community.


### 1-a. Research management

A crucial skill for a researcher is to effectively design and execute the lifecycle of a research project. This involves:

- Understanding the research landscape and current technological demands;
- Formulating insightful research questions;
- Establishing appropriate benchmarks and evaluation methodologies;
- Preparing simple baseline approaches;
- Generating a list of hypotheses and methods to explore;
- Summarising and interpreting the results;
- Coming back to the research audience and presenting the research outcomes.

**Minimum**: Independently manage one's own research project.

**Ideal**: Expertly oversee multiple research projects by delegating tasks to junior researchers.



### 1-b. Expertise

Collaborative tasks greatly benefit from the involvement of *experts*.
This is what makes PhD holders valuable human resources in large, multi-disciplinary collaborative projects.
Drawing inspiration from Ray Dalio's concept of "believable people," I define *experts* as *individuals who have successfully accomplished a particular task at least three times*. Moreover, they possess a profound understanding of the cause-effect relationships that led them to their conclusions.

In the context of machine learning research, a person can be considered an expert if they have served as the first author for at least three successful research projects. As the main planner, primary coder, and primary writer for respective conference papers, they have demonstrated their competence. Additionally, they must be capable of explaining the fundamental principles and mechanisms behind their research contributions.

**Minimum**: Three first-author conference papers published in top-tier venues or their equivalent. The ability to articulate both the high-level story and technical details is essential.

**Ideal**: A more extensive publication record and compelling narratives to support their accomplishments.



### 1-c. Research leadership

A competent researcher makes valuable contributions through individual research papers. However, an outstanding researcher goes beyond this and becomes a leader in their field.

The research community greatly benefits from such leadership. These exceptional individuals possess the ability to identify and address unsolved problems. To achieve this, they must be willing to defy prevailing trends, challenge conventional wisdom, and venture into unexplored territory.

**Minimum**: Proficiently present, communicate, and disseminate their own research contributions.

**Ideal**: Open up a new research field; lead a paradigm shift in thinking, and attract fellow researchers to engage with the problems they are tackling.




## 2. Who's ready for a PhD program?

PhD is not easy. Naturally, not everyone is fit for the program. Below are the factors that seem to be critical for a successful completion of a PhD.

### 2-a. Research stamina

Engaging in research involves facing daily challenges and uncertainties. This can be especially demanding for junior researchers with limited experience. Some students demonstrate a remarkable ability to bounce back quickly from setbacks. This resilience, often referred to as "passion," "motivation," or "perseverance," can be critical. It doesn't necessarily have to stem from a deep love for research or thirst for knowledge in my personal opinion; it can also be driven by the pursuit of a successful career or a desire for a high salary after completing the PhD. Additionally, students who possess robust physical and mental strength can explore ideas more rapidly and frequently, which significantly aids their progress.


### 2-b. Alignment of research topic

Ensuring alignment between the student and the advisor on the research topic is crucial. Otherwise, the advisor's guidance may be limited. From my personal experience, I find it highly effective when a student's research topic falls within my broader research interests but extends slightly beyond my specific expertise. This approach fosters the student's independent research abilities and accelerates the development of their expertise. Simultaneously, it expands my domain of expertise and allows me to recruit a more diverse range of students and collaborators.


### 2-c. Writing and communication skills

Strong written and verbal communication skills are indispensable for effective research. Acquiring these skills takes time; students **must** have those skills prior to embarking on the PhD program.


### 2-d. Personal traits

As a PhD program involves a collaborative effort spanning 3-4 years, personal traits play a significant role. I assess whether a candidate is likeable, optimistic, and capable of integrating well with the existing team. Feedback from current members of my research group helps inform this evaluation process.


### 2-e. Diversity

It is important to avoid rigid replications of a specific formula for successful supervision. 
Seeking students who resemble past successful candidates can limit the diversity of my research group. 
To address this, I try to be open to various types of students who possess exceptional potential for a successful PhD in different ways. 
I strive to move beyond my comfort zone in supervision and embrace individuals with diverse characteristics such as basic demographics, industrial experience, undergraduate major, personality traits (e.g., extroversion vs. introversion), research methodologies (e.g., theoretical vs. experimental), and learning styles (e.g., bottom-up vs. top-down). 
This approach aims to cultivate a research group that encompasses a broader range of researchers, enabling collaboration with different perspectives and methodologies in the future.


## 3. PhD Curriculum

Unlike undergraduate or master's programs, a PhD program often lacks structure. 
This lack of structure can pose challenges for PhD students, as they invest the precious 3-4 years of their early career into the program without knowing how much progress they will make and when they will finish.
It's thus important to set intermediate milestones and have a clear assessment of their progress throughout the process. 
I have developed a concrete blueprint for the PhD program within my research group. 
Consider this blueprint as a general guideline that has to be tailored to each student's individual needs and circumstances.

Regarding the duration of the PhD, I recommend a 4-year plan that includes an external internship in the middle. However, it is also sensible to aim for a 3-year PhD without an internship.



### 3-a. First year

For many students entering a PhD program, the beginning can be overwhelming. I hope the guidance below makes it a bit easier with a clearer set of expectations.

**PhD topic**

If students don't have a specific topic in mind, I propose a few promising options. I encourage them to explore these topics for a maximum of one month. It's important for them to experience a full paper cycle early on rather than spending excessive time on topic selection.

**Research methodology**

For students with a specific topic of interest, I advise them to identify the existing gap between the current state of affairs and the desired outcome. This process allows them to gain expertise in the latest technological advancements. Simply reading papers isn't sufficient for a precise assessment; they need to (re-)implement state-of-the-art techniques. This exercise helps them develop a clear vision of the future they envision. Once the gap is identified, students can contribute to the community in two primary ways:

- Present the current state of affairs from a fresh perspective.
- Take a step towards closing the identified gap.

I consider this approach a low-risk, moderate-return research methodology, which I typically recommend to first-year PhD students.

In the early stages, students may not yet have a high-level understanding of the project, including broader motivations, historical context, current trends in the field, and the relationship with other work. Consequently, they often require significant assistance in writing the introduction, related work, and conclusion sections, while the method and experiments sections are usually handled more proficiently. As an advisor, my role is to gradually delegate the writing task for those high-level sections to students as they develop expertise in the field.

**Publication objective**

The primary objective is to achieve the first-author publication. This process helps students acquire essential research management skills.

**Research collaboration**

While research collaboration is generally beneficial, I advise against students participating as co-authors (as opposed to as first-authors) in papers at this stage.
They need to write a first-author paper first.
This is the most basic qualification to be the minimal expert in any collaborative research project.

Instead, I try to provide collaborative opportunities through co-supervision with internal and external senior researchers.
This way, students can still take the lead in the project as the first author.

**Networking**

Students are encouraged to participate in networking opportunities such as summer schools and conferences. The main requirement is to enjoy the experience and make new friends. This fosters resilience during challenging times in the PhD journey. Additionally, building a social network becomes a valuable asset after finishing the PhD program. This will later help them transition to different universities, companies, cities, and countries around the world. Networking is essential throughout the PhD program.

**Teaching & organisational duties**

I ask my students for certain favours, such as tutoring a course and organising group events, throughout their PhD.
Tutoring provides a teaching experience opportunity for students and connects the PhD students with excellent masters and undergrad students. 
They could build collaboration at a later stage, e.g. from the second year.
Organisational duties further enhance their experience in hosting academic events, and developing necessary soft skills for research leadership.


**Main milestones**

- Define a high-level topic for the PhD.
- Gain in-depth knowledge of the state of the art in the chosen topic.
- Complete one cycle of research paper submission as the first author.
- Get to know researchers from various backgrounds.



### 3-b. Second year

In the second year of their PhD, students gain a higher-level perspective on their research field. 
They learn to connect more than one research project into a coherent story. 

**Publication objective**

The primary objective is to write the second paper as the first author. Students may also participate in co-authored papers, such as through supervising master's students or engaging in research collaborations.

**Research collaboration & supervision**

Having completed the first paper, students are now ready to actively participate in research collaborations. They will be recognised as semi-experts in their research topics, and their role and expected contributions within the team will be clearer. Participation in such collaborations is encouraged as long as they do not significantly hinder the writing of their first-author papers. Research collaborations provide an opportunity to strengthen their PhD story by diversifying their approaches and research methodologies. Students may also take on the role of supervising junior students, such as those pursuing master's degrees, which allows them to expand their research bandwidth. This stage involves learning how to branch a big research goal into multiple smaller threads. 

Students learn to transfer their research management skills to junior students. In exceptional cases, they may also develop research leadership skills through the experience. Students may be invited to review submissions for conferences. Reviewing is a highly recommended activity that allows them to view research projects from the reviewer's perspective.


**PhD topic**

The first research paper serves as the starting point, and with the second paper, students set the direction of their research. They develop the skill of composing a research story that extends beyond individual papers. It is important not to wait until the story is fixed before proceeding with the second and third research papers. Sometimes they just need to do it without too much planning. 
Once a set of papers is in their portfolio, it is almost always possible to find a greater underlying theme for the research outputs.


**Main milestones**

- Overall direction for the PhD.
- Finish two cycles of research paper submissions as the first author.
- Parallelise 2+ research threads through research collaboration or supervision.
- Expand the social network beyond Tübingen.



### 3-c. Third year

In the third year of their PhD, students further expand their research project in both depth and breadth. The PhD story becomes stronger and more concrete, and they gain solid expertise in their topic of interest. This expansion involves scaling up the research significantly by adding more parallel threads through collaborations and supervision.

**Publication objective**

The objective is to write the third and possibly fourth research papers as the first author. 

**PhD topic**

By the end of the third year, successful students will have written 3-4 first-author papers, possibly with a few co-authored papers. A key exercise for students is to identify a coherent story that ties together their research projects. In this process, students discover their own research identity, gravitating toward specific research topics and methodologies that naturally attract them. 
Building on their understanding of their unique research approach, they can formulate a more precise long-term research target. This long-term goal then guides their decision on the next project to undertake. At this point, students may have successfully completed three first-author projects with a strong, coherent story.
The graduation is in sight. 


**Research collaboration, supervision, and community service**

Students continue their research collaborations and supervision of junior students. With 2-3 research threads, they learn to manage their own research and collaborative projects. They also diversify their research approaches and sub-topics, expanding their expertise.

Students take on more roles in the research community, such as reviewers. In special circumstances where their expertise is recognised and sought, they may also be invited to organise workshops and give talks. They will be great opportunities to expand their influence in the academic community.


**Main milestones**

- Finalise the overall PhD story.
- Third and possibly fourth first-author papers.
- Diversify research threads through collaboration and supervision.
- Keep expanding the influence and presence in the research community.



### 3-d. Fourth year

Assuming at least one internship during the program, it is realistic to aim to complete the PhD by the fourth year. By this stage, students ideally have met all the minimum expectations for a PhD. They have become independent researchers with a unique research philosophy and insightful ideas to advance the field.


**PhD Topic**

Students write their thesis based on the research projects undertaken during the PhD journey. While writing individual papers may not provide the opportunity to present a high-level story encompassing multiple papers, the PhD thesis and defense talk offer great platforms to communicate the underlying logic behind their research trajectory. They can share the future directions of their work as well.

The PhD Committee, composed of evaluators, can also become an important asset later on. It is advised that students choose evaluators who can potentially support their future career endeavours.

**Internship**

An internship serves as a unique perk during the PhD program. It provides an excellent opportunity to gain experience in one or more companies for a short period without making long-term commitments. Personally, I find internships during the PhD to be unmatched by any other employment arrangement. I strongly recommend my PhD students to explore internship opportunities before graduation.

An internship offers a distinctive experience as students collaborate with a completely different team of researchers, often without their main PhD supervisor. Working with diverse researchers broadens their perspectives, exposing them to different research approaches and topics of interest. Finally, an internship significantly expands the social network, providing valuable connections for their next career stages. 


**Main milestones**

- Full capability to conduct independent research.
- Research leadership: Effectively communicate an overarching view of the research trajectory and attract others to join and contribute to this trajectory.
