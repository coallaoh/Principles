# Principles for Research

Research is about dealing with uncertainty. It is about inventing ideas and methods that have not existed before. You are never sure if your ideas and methods will work out in a month, in a year, or in a decade. Sometimes, you will need to make a radical viewpoint that goes against the majority. You do not know whether and when people will start listen to you.

A good approach to dealing with uncertainties is to introduce “anchors”. I have my own set of principles for research that provide a good prior for anchoring my approach to the uncertainties. They provide the rule-of-thumb guidance on the strategy to tackle research problems and the effective mindset for building collaborations with others.

Those principles are anchors, but they do get updated in the long term. As I gather more data from direct and indirect experience, I will be able to correct and refine the existing principles and introduce new ones. The document will be updated accordingly.

This document is aimed for three types of audience:

- Junior researchers: They might find this a good starting point to build their own principles towards a successful research career.
- Collaborators: They will understand the core values I pursue in research.
- My students: Both of the above apply to my students.

## Academic integrity

There are some commonsense rules that I expect myself and collaborators to live up to:

- Never steal someone else’s idea;
- Proactively credit those who helped; and
- Do not lie with numbers.

Apart from those commonsense rules, one must conform to the regulations and policies for each academic venue: conferences, journals, workshops, summer schools, etc. Examples include guidelines on the anonymity of authors and reviewers, dual submission, and plagiarism.

Academic integrity forms the fundamental base of your academic reputation. Aim for **never losing it** throughout your academic career. Once you lose your reputation, it is nearly impossible to recover.

## Communication, collaboration, and argumentation

Research involves lots of communication, collaboration, and argumentation. There are many common pitfalls that could hinder the research progress and effective exchange of ideas and opinions. I summarise them below.

### Question the authority

Authority comes in many forms in academia. It can be whether one has a PhD or not; whether one has written a paper on a certain topic or not; whether one has majored in a certain subject or not; whether one is older than you and has generally more life experience than you do.

Authority **never** logically supports the soundness of an argument. A professor who has written 100 papers on topic ABC is not exempt from the duty to provide evidence for their claims related to topic ABC. Authority only sets an expectation that the person will find good supporting evidence for their arguments.

Another form of authority in academia comes in the form of popularity. For example, the fact that most researchers evaluate their methods under the protocol DEF does not excuse one to follow the same protocol DEF. Every researcher must re-examine the practices and procedures based on their own soundness, independent of their popularity.

### Do not rely on your own authority

As much as we must watch out for others who cling to authority, we should watch ourselves carefully if they are making arguments based on our own authority. Relying on authority will become more and more tempting in our research careers because we will be granted shiny titles, higher social status, and greater impact. We will learn that flashing our authority is a quick way to convince our correctness. This is a threat to the scientific progress which requires logical arguments and critical scrutiny. This is why we **always** need to make efforts to not take advantage of whatever authority we have to make our point. The habit sticks.

Some practical guide. Avoid starting your turn saying “speaking as someone who has majored in XYZ” or “from my N years of career in industry”. Basing your argument on your experience or knowledge is fine, but your example shall be more precise. Tell others “which materials and results from your major” and “what specific anecdote from your industrial experience” support your argument. There’s a fine difference between presenting evidence that are precisely chosen to support your argument versus alluding to your authority.

### Research is about making a breakthrough

Research is not about making reviewers happy. It is about finding new problems that people have overlooked and coming up with a creative solution. More broadly, research is about changing the way people think. There are types of research that are optimized for pleasing reviewers. Such research may be worthless for the actual progress. We shall not shy away from making bold claims and confronting reviewers and critics, if necessary. “Because others do” is the worst reason. We do not follow others. We lead.

### Brutal honesty

Progress is impossible without criticism. The first attempt we make is almost always full of error and nonsense, whether it be a research agenda, a piece of code, or the first draft for the paper. There is a long way to go between the initial work and the final product. If we put too much energy into choosing the right words, we may fail to make the needed progress. We need to be ready to make brutal criticism on others’ work and be ready to take such from the others.

One needs to clearly separate the assessment on the work from the one on the person who did it. One should be very careful with the assessment on the person because that leaves a strong memory and impact on the person’s life. But it is okay to criticize their work directly, quickly, and even brutally, as long as we share the principle that the critique on one’s work is separate from the critique on the person. We know that even great people make shit, especially for their first attempts. It is our duty to let them quickly go beyond that state by being honest.

### Open-mindedness

While it is crucial as scientists to have critical views, we should be careful not to be harsh and cynical on everything. 

One crucial occasion when we must refrain from being critical is at the inception stage of an idea. As researchers, we make things that lack the right words and concepts yet. It’s often challenging to convince the audience of one's new great idea because they are bound to existing words and concepts, which in turn bound the audience's imagination to existing things and stuff. Great ideas can sound boring and familiar at first.

When talking about exciting new research ideas, our basic attitude shall be welcoming, curious, and forgiving. 
- **Welcoming**: Do not neglect anyone who comes to you with new insights and ideas, as much as your situation allows.
- **Curious**: Assume that we do not fully understand the marvellous insights hidden in the person in front of you. It is a human instinct to attach a familiar label to a novel idea; fight that instinct. Refrain from saying “oh I know what you’re talking about”.
- **Relaxed**: Do not demand each other to use more concrete language and mathematical formulation to describe the idea. They can come later. We need to acknowledge the fundamental limitations of language as the container for great ideas. 

You can help the other person formulate the idea into language and mathematics. However, you need to make it clear that you are only suggesting to help the formulation, not criticising or judging it yet. You need to continuously synchronise with the person if your suggested formulation agrees with the marvellous insights hidden in the other person. Be careful because this "help" may also kill the potentially great idea, if not done right.
