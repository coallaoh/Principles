# Principles for Relationship

Relationships are where life happens. Most of my emotional energy goes into relationships with family, friends, and colleagues. Getting them right matters more than career success. I learned much about relationships through marriage, and from Dale Carnegie's *How to Win Friends and Influence People*, my family, my therapist, and ChatGPT.

## 1. Human nature

Never criticise. Criticism puts people on the defensive and rarely changes behaviour. It damages relationships more than it corrects mistakes.

Praise and appreciate generously instead. People thrive when they feel valued. Sincere appreciation opens doors that criticism keeps shut.

Self-esteem is precious beyond measure. This applies to everyone without exception. Children and adults alike protect their sense of self-worth fiercely. When you harm someone's self-esteem, you gain nothing. You only create resentment and distance.

Everyone carries a child within themselves. That inner child formed during early years and still drives much of our emotional life. Treat others with this understanding. The adult in front of you still has a vulnerable child inside who needs respect and kindness.

## 2. How to treat others

Smile when meeting anyone. Family, friends, colleagues, strangers. A genuine smile signals warmth before any words are spoken. It costs nothing but changes the entire dynamic of an interaction.

Think of each person as a character from your favourite story. Some characters are difficult to like at first. But there is always a reason they became who they are. Their flaws come from somewhere. If you look with curiosity rather than judgement, you will find something likeable in everyone.

Give your full attention to the person in front of you. This is rare and precious. Most people are half-listening while thinking about something else. Plan your day so nothing distracts you when you are with someone. Put away your phone. Clear your mental clutter beforehand.

Remember names, faces, remarkable facts, and birthdays. Write them down if you must. Then show people later that you remember. Few things make someone feel more valued than being remembered in detail.

## 3. Eliciting change in others

Accept this first: People will not change. At least not at the speed or way you want.

You may see their flaws clearly. You may know exactly what they should do differently. None of that matters. They will change only when they are ready, on their own terms.

The best you can do is change yourself. This is the only variable fully under your control. Work on your own reactions, your own patience, your own growth. Often, when you find something wrong in others, half of that comes from within you. When you change yourself, the relationship changes too.

What you can try is to lead others positively. Encourage what you want to see more of. Then relax and see what happens. There is no guarantee of results. Sometimes something magical happens and people surprise you. But do not rely on luck. Expect nothing and appreciate whatever comes.

## 4. Handling disputes

Say sorry. This solves most disputes quickly. Especially with your spouse. Who cares if you are right or not? You may feel tremendous resistance against saying sorry beforehand. You may feel tempted to say sorry in a cynical tone without really meaning it. Hold it back and just try this once. Just say sorry with full sincerity. You will see the tension going down between you and the other person, and also inside your mind.

**But then will you ever get a chance to tell them what is wrong with them? How will they learn their weaknesses at all?**

I am not saying that you should never tell them their weaknesses. I am saying that disputes are the wrong moments to teach them lessons. Perhaps the worst moments. A dispute is not a teaching moment. You cannot change other people through disputes and criticism. It simply does not work.

**What if they are really wrong?**

Perhaps. But maybe you are the one who is wrong. You never know. You cannot ever truly be impartial in a dispute. Even if they are truly wrong, this is not the occasion to address it. If they are wrong, they likely know it already. They may acknowledge it when their brain cools down.

**Who will take care of my hurt feelings?**

Your feelings are hurt, yes. But do not seek comfort in the other person - not because they are right and you are wrong. It is because they are not ready to provide this care. Instead, you are the one who must look after your own feelings. It is the child self in you who is hurt, not the grown-up self. As a fully grown adult, treat that child in you as you would an actual child. Acknowledge the feelings deeply and justify them.

**Does this also apply to professional, societal, and political disputes?**

No. The scope here is personal disputes. For more official disputes, especially when you are representing others, you will need a different approach. This is beyond the scope of this document.


## 5. Handling 3rd-party disputes

Sometimes people you love are in conflict with each other. Your spouse and your parents. Your child and your spouse. How should you intervene?

Accept this first: There is no way you can intervene directly. You cannot mediate or referee. Any attempt to do so will likely backfire.

The best you can do is build good pairwise relationships. Focus on your relationship with your spouse. Focus on your relationship with your parents. Focus on your relationship with your child. Each bond must be strong on its own. Give each person appreciation and care for their self-esteem. Show how much you love them. This alone reduces most of the emotional difficulty.

**Am I not contradicting myself by showing empathy to both sides?**

You show empathy to one side, then to the other, even when they have opposing views. This feels dishonest. But it is not. Separate facts from emotions. When talking to each party, show empathy for their feelings, not necessarily for their views or factual claims. What they need is confirmation that their feelings and viewpoints are justified, not necessarily the facts. It is not contradictory to acknowledge the feelings of both sides.


## 6. Relationship with myself

When you get emotionally carried away, try to see it as a small child in you taking control. This child formed during your early years. It still lives inside you and reacts to the world in old patterns.

Just watch it. Do not try to control it or suppress it. Suppression does not work. Observation is the only way to gradually loosen its grip.

Build a good relationship with this inner child. The child tries to do many things on your behalf. It works too hard. It gets addicted to distractions. It handles situations emotionally. It becomes cynical and defensive. These are all protective mechanisms. Do not fight them. Instead, give the child praise and positive encouragement. This is how you elicit change in yourself, just as with others.
