## Goals

**Lifetime**

- When I die, I wish to have no desire to live longer or live an afterlife. I wish to have no regrets, having lived a full life.
- I want to give my best to the people around me.
    - Love to my family, friends, and co-workers.
    - I want to succeed, without leaving others behind.
- I wish to live three professional lives - as a researcher and inventor (age 30-50), as an investor (age 50-70), and as a writer and artist (age 70-90).
- Researcher and investor (age 30-50)
    - It is an exciting time with the emergence of computer technologies that automatise and speed up tedious tasks. I wish to ride this big tide and be part of the state of art.
    - I desire to guide the field, bring new perspectives to the problems, and invent solutions.
    - I want to learn how to turn technology into products that change people’s lives.
    - I will get myself prepared for the next stage:
        - Expertise in 3+ fields
        - Leadership experience
        - Business experience
        - Collect a sufficient amount of personal equity
- Investor and advisor (age 50-70)
    - Contribute to technology with knowledge, experience, and money.
    - Address the most pressing problem for mankind.
    - Advise and invest in companies to blossom their technology into profitable businesses.
- Writer and artist (age 70-90)
    - I am intrigued by the kinds of experiences and feelings that are very unique to individuals and yet are shared by many others.
    - I like sharing such abstract thoughts and emotions with others, possibly borrowing artistic forms like writing, music, and painting.
    - I hope to share such work with generations ahead.
- Stay fit throughout.
