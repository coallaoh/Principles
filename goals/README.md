## Goals

**Lifetime**

- I want to give my best to the people around me.
    - Love to my family, friends, and co-workers.
    - I want to succeed, without leaving others behind.

- Writer and artist (age 70-90)
    - I am intrigued by the kinds of experiences and feelings that are very unique to individuals and yet are shared by many others.
    - I like sharing such abstract thoughts and emotions with others, possibly borrowing artistic forms like writing, music, and painting.

  <summary>2023 goals</summary>

- Manage the Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI) group.
    - Recruit 1 PhD student and 1 postdoc.
        - Failed to recruit postdoc for the STAI group.
    - Manage group activities like reading groups, seminars, retreats, and social events.
        - We had reading groups, retreats, and some social events.
    - Introduce a tie between STAI group and the Naver project.
        - Not achieved yet. Thinking about possibilities to let Naver be involved in Tübingen.
- Papers
    - Make 5 oral-quality submissions on STAI.
        - This was an ambitious goal. I'd score 3/5. 
    - 2 groundbreaking research outputs from the Naver project.
        - There was one cool research output. Score: 1/5.
- Advising
    - Keep the average time to first paper below 1 year, without any shortcuts like writing the whole paper for the students.
        - Not many samples to take the average yet. Will maintain this goal next year.
    - 1 hour per week per student to think about their research & career.

  <summary>2022 goals</summary>
  
- Build a lab on Scalable Trustworthy AI (STAI).
    - Recruit 2 PhD students and 1 postdoc (research scientist).
        - 3 PhD students. Found a research scientist collaborator for the Naver project.
    - Build automatisation tools and systems for the research lab.
        - Notion page, web page, Slack, ...
    - Secure funding for the large-scale trustworthy AI from Naver.
        - Funding secured for the Naver project.
- Papers
    - Make 3 key submissions on STAI with existing collaborators.
        - There was only one key submission.
    - One oral paper at a top-tier conference.
        - No oral paper. There's not so much one could do about this. What's important is to publish papers that are above my own research criteria.
- Expertise on STAI
    - Do not let the reading list queue beyond 20 items.
        - It went far beyond 20 items. Not a good measure though.
    - Teach a course on "Trustworthy ML".
        - Yes: https://scalabletrustworthyai.github.io/courses/tml_winter_2223/.
- Advising
    - 2 hours per week to talk to each student.
        - 1 hour is often sufficient for individual meetings. This is also fulfilled through group meetings and lunch. Setting a quantitative goal is perhaps not a good idea.
    - 1 hour per week per student to think about their research & career.
        - Often fulfilled through reading recent papers on their topics. I feel the need to spend more time on this.
    - Get the students and postdoc ready to write a paper towards ICCV 2023, ICML 2023, or the likes.
        - This is hard. I'm studying the best way to speed up the time-to-first-paper as well as the actual acquisition of research skills that are going to be helpful for efficient research beyond the first paper.
- Stay fit: Tennis (1 hour x 2 / week), Run (5 km in 30 min x 2 / week), Yoga (30 minutes x 2 / week).
    - I like tennis, but the courts are often only available in Summer in Germany. Running is always good. I don't enjoy Yoga. 
    - I'm staying fit.
